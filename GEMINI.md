# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This is the official website for QIRI'M YOUNG, an organization dedicated to preserving and developing the Crimean Tatar language and culture through digital innovation.

The website is a single-page application (SPA) built with **React 19** and **TypeScript**. It uses **Vite** as a build tool and is styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**. The project is optimized for performance with lazy loading components, code splitting, and other techniques.

The site is multilingual, using **i18next** for internationalization. It features several pages, including a homepage, about page, projects page, and more. The routing is handled by **React Router**.

## Building and Running

### Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note**: The development server runs successfully at `http://localhost:5175/` (or similar port) with all CSS and functionality working as expected. This was confirmed early in the conversation.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified production build.

**Current Status**: The production build is currently failing. See the "Troubleshooting Build Issues" section for details.

### Linting

To lint the codebase:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling**: The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Customizations and the color palette are defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Components**: The project is structured with reusable components located in `src/components`. Pages are located in `src/pages`.
*   **Routing**: The application uses **React Router** for client-side routing. The routes are defined in `src/App.tsx`.
*   **Internationalization**: The project uses **i18next** for internationalization. The configuration is in `src/i18n/config.ts`. All interface elements are translated into English, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tatar.
*   **Performance**: The project is optimized for performance. This includes lazy loading components, code splitting, and other optimizations in the Vite configuration.
*   **Deployment**: The project is intended to be deployed to GitHub Pages. The deployment script is in `package.json` under the `deploy` script.

## Summary of Actions and Troubleshooting

This section summarizes the actions taken and the persistent issues encountered during the build process.

**Initial State**: The development server was confirmed to be working correctly, displaying the website with proper styling and functionality at `http://localhost:5175/`. The primary goal was to prepare a production build and deploy it.

**Build Issues Encountered**: The `npm run build` command consistently failed with two main types of errors:

1.  **Tailwind CSS Unknown Utility Class**: Errors like `Cannot apply unknown utility class 
`bg-heritage-gold
`` or `bg-blue-500` indicated that Tailwind CSS was not correctly processing custom or even standard utility classes during the build process.
2.  **JSX Parsing Errors in `.js` files**: Errors like `Expression expected` in `.js` files within the `src/components` directory suggested that transpiled JavaScript files (likely generated by TypeScript) were being incorrectly processed as source files containing JSX, leading to syntax errors.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken (Unsuccessful in resolving build)**:

*   **Dependency Management**: Updated all `npm` dependencies, deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and reinstalled them multiple times.
*   **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Re-initialized Tailwind CSS configuration files (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`), and manually configured `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`. Attempted to downgrade `tailwindcss` to version 3.
*   **Build Script Modification**: Removed `tsc -b` from the `build` script in `package.json` as it was suspected of generating problematic `.js` files.
*   **CSS Build Process**: Attempted to build CSS separately using `tailwindcss` CLI and `postcss-cli` to isolate the issue.
*   **TypeScript Configuration**: Ensured `tsconfig.app.json` had `"jsx": "react-jsx"` and tried regenerating `tsconfig.json`.
*   **File Management**: Repeatedly deleted all `.js` files from `src/components` and other `src` subdirectories, but they were regenerated during subsequent build attempts.
*   **Project Migration**: Attempted to create a new Vite project from scratch and migrate the source files, but encountered similar build issues.

**Current Assessment**: The core issue seems to be a complex interaction between Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS during the production build. The presence and incorrect processing of `.js` files (likely transpiled artifacts) alongside the original `.tsx` files, combined with Tailwind CSS's failure to recognize utility classes in this build environment, are preventing a successful production build. The development server's success suggests the core application logic and styling are sound, but the build pipeline is misconfigured or encountering an incompatibility.
